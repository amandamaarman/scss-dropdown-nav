# SCSS Dropdown Navigation

This is a dropdown navigation written in pure Sassâ€”no JavaScript under the hood. The example is derived from [phpacademy](http://phpacademy.org)'s [tutorial to make a pure CSS dropdown navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYN8FUiKfzA).

The idea with this example is to show an alternative way of achieving the effect of a dropdown that is shown when a menu item has been clicked. This shows that it can be done with less markup.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Sass 3.4.9](http://sass-lang.com/)

## I'd like to see how it works, what do I do?

Clone the repository with `git`

    $ git clone git:github.com/fnky/scss-dropdown-nav.git

or download the repository as a ZIP file.  

You can open the `index.html` to see the example. However, if you'd like to experiement with it, you'll need to install the dependencies.

    $ npm install && bower install

When done, you can run `gulp` in your terminal. This will load your browser and you can begin experiementing.

The project uses Gulp to watch files and [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) to inject changes into your browser so you'll see the changes immediatly!
